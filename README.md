Food

This iOS App aims to provide customers with the restaurant information and reservation service. 

It provides a basic framework, therefore it's eary to use new API to quickly implement a new app.


Tip
====
I suggest that downloading code and run by Xcode firstly, and then pick the specific files relating to functions of app that you are interested in.
